## Overview

[`Sinograms.jl`](https://github.com/JeffFessler/Sinograms.jl).
is a Julia language package
with tools for tomographic image reconstruction,
including
* describing ray geometries (parallel beam, fan beam, etc.)
* performing filtered back-projection (FBP) image reconstruction
* system models for iterative reconstruction

It is all a WIP.
See the examples
